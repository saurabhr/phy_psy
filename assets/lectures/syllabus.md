# Make-up and late policy

NO MAKE-UPS WILL BE GIVEN ON ANY MATERIAL FOR THIS COURSE, except for university excused absences with adequate documentation (i.e. doctor's note). Documentation should be provided at least 7 hours before the course material is due unless there are extenuating circumstances. Doctor's notes etc. must be provided as soon as possible. Makeups need to be completed no later than a week after the material was due (including weekends and holidays). Thus, if the material was due on Wednesday, then it must be completed by the following Friday unless there are extenuating circumstances. **Late work is allowed on most individual assignments. Individual assignments that are marked in canvas as such are allowed to be up to 3 days late but will have a penalty of 2.5 pts for each day.**

# Proctoring

Quizzes for this course are proctored by HonorLock. The benefits of HonorLock are that the proctoring framework is embedded in Canvas without intrusiveness and the need for prior scheduling. The goal of proctoring in this course is to place all students on a level field. Benefits of this technological support for our course include convenience and technical support for assessments online. At the start of the semester please examine and ensure the minimum requirements for your learning environment, and take the practice quiz in Canvas.

# Honesty policy

Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. Students who are caught cheating or plagiarizing will be subjected to the Student Honor Code Process.

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states, "We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code." On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: "On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment." The Conduct Code specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code, including cheating and plagiarism, and the possible sanctions. If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with the Instructor in this class.

# In-Class Recording

Students are allowed to record video or audio of class lectures. However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used are strictly controlled. The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding. All other purposes are prohibited. Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the Instructor.

A "class lecture" is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any Instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any Instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest Instructor, as part of a University of Florida course. A class lecture does **not include** lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or guest lecturer during a class session.

**Publication without permission of the Instructor is prohibited**. To _"publish" means_ to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to another person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section. Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third party note/tutoring services. A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.

# Online Course Evaluation

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals. Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available at [https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/).

Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or via [https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/).

Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students at [https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).

# Accomodations for Students with Disability

Students with disabilities who experience learning barriers and would like to request academic accommodations should connect with the disability Resource Center by visiting [https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/). It is important for students to share their accommodation letter with their instructor and discuss their access needs, as early as possible in the semester. The Dean of Students Office will provide documentation to the student who must then provide this documentation to the instructor when requesting accommodation. You must submit this documentation prior to submitting assignments or taking the quizzes or exams. Accommodations are not retroactive; therefore, students should contact the office as soon as possible in the term for which they are seeking accommodations.

# Sex or Gender Discrimination Resources

UF fosters a campus free of sexual violence including sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and/or any form of sex or gender discrimination. In support thereof, if you disclose a personal experience as a UF student, the Instructor may be required to notify the Title IX Coordinator by completing the report form available at https://titleix.ufl.edu/report-an-issue/, emailing titleix@ad.ufl.edu or calling (352) 273-1094.
